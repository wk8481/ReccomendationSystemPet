# RecommendationSystemPet

## 📚 Overview

Welcome to the RecommendationSystemPet repository! This project implements a content-based recommendation system using the Amazon Reviews dataset. The system leverages user and product attributes to provide personalized recommendations.

## 📂 Project Structure

- **`LICENSE`**: Contains the MIT License information.
- **`README.md`**: This file, providing an overview and instructions for the project.
- **`RecommendationSystem.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation of the content-based recommendation system.

## 📈 Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Amazon Reviews dataset, which can be found [here](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/datasets.html#amazon_reviews). Due to its large size (1.5 GB), the dataset is not included in this repository. Please download it from the provided link.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/wk8481/RecommendationSystemPet.git
   cd RecommendationSystemPet
   ```

2. **Install the required libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. **Download the dataset** from [Amazon Reviews dataset](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/datasets.html#amazon_reviews) and save it in your preferred directory.
2. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook RecommendationSystem.ipynb
   ```
3. **Run the notebook cells** to preprocess the data, build the recommendation model, and generate recommendations.

### Example

An example usage of the recommendation system can be found in the `RecommendationSystem.ipynb` notebook.

## 📚 How It Works

The recommendation system uses the following steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Load and preprocess the dataset to extract relevant features.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Create content-based features for users and products.
3. **Model Training**: Train a content-based recommendation model using the engineered features.
4. **Generate Recommendations**: Use the trained model to generate personalized recommendations for users.
